;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a reduced version of this file:
;; https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/early-init.el.
;;
;; It should only include non-Doom bootstrap code, i.e.: don't include code
;; that tries to load either doom or its configuration, since in nix-doom-emacs
;; we load doom-emacs from site-packages instead.
;;
;; This file should be synced with upstream from time to time.
;;
;;; Code:

;; A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by
;; enabling `gcmh-mode'. Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; In noninteractive sessions, prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
;; prevent the use of stale byte-code. Otherwise, it saves us a little IO time
;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.
